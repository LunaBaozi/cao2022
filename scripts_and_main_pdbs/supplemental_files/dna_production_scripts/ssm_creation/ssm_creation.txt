This is a guide to help you prepare your SSM libraries.


1. Picking pdbs

You obviously need to pick your best binders for the SSM, we'll leave
 that step up to you.


2. Producing original sequence files

Once you have them though, you need to produce 2 files:

to_order_just_ssm.seq -- unpadded protein sequences
to_order_just_ssm.dna -- fully-padded-adaptor'd DNA sequences

Both of these files have the same format:
SEQUENCE NAME


If you've been following along with chip_level_dna.txt, you can obtain
 these two files like this:


Create: ssm_tags.list -- contains the names you want to order

Then:
cat ssm_tags.list | grep -f- to_order.seq > to_order_just_ssm.seq
cat ssm_tags.list | grep -f- DNA_sequence_adapter.list | awk '{print $NF,$2}' > to_order_just_ssm.dna


Ensure that the newly created files have the right number of lines. If
 they have too many (because you have designs with very similar names),
 you can modify the commands like this.

cat ssm_tags.list | awk '{print " "$1"$"}' | grep -f- to_order.seq > to_order_just_ssm.seq
cat ssm_tags.list | awk '{print " "$1" "}' | grep -f- DNA_sequence_adapter.list | awk '{print $NF,$2}' > to_order_just_ssm.dna


3. Extract the design-coding DNA

Next, we're going to extract the actual coding DNA for your designs

./extract_dna_sequence_no_pad.py to_order_just_ssm.dna to_order_just_ssm.seq > originals.dna


This script may say "Partial Sequence!!". This is fine. It's because your
 230 bp DNA sequence is 1 character short of a multiple of 3 (so partial
 codon).



4. Turn the DNA into a fasta file

cat originals.dna | awk '{print ">"$2"\n"$1"\n"}' > originals.fasta


5. Create the SSM DNA

We'll use a script that Eva Strauch made here:

./make_explicit_SSM.py --in=originals.fasta --table=k12.condons.tab > originals_SSM.dna



6. Add the padding and adapters back to the sequences

This script reuses the original padding and adapters from your original order:

./repad_dna_sequence_for_ssm.py to_order_just_ssm.dna to_order_just_ssm.seq originals_SSM.dna > SSM_DNA_W_ADAPTER.txt

It may say "Partial sequence!!!". Just like in step 3, this is probably fine.


7. Convert to orderable text format

SSM_DNA_W_ADAPTER.txt contains the final DNA we want to order. Here are two other formats you might want:

TEXT file of just DNA:
cat SSM_DNA_W_ADAPTER.txt  | awk '{print $1}' > TO_ORDER_SSM_DNA.txt


FASTA file original names:
cat SSM_DNA_W_ADAPTER.txt | awk '{print ">"$2"\n"$1"\n"}' > TO_ORDER_SSM_DNA.fasta
