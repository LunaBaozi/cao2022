Can't figure out how to run one of our scripts? No worries, all of these commands ran for us.

# Estimate affinity keeping track of doubly-transformed cells

# Create some SSM heatmaps

cd supplemental_files/ngs_analysis_scripts/ssm_stuff;
create_ssm_graphs.ipynb should already be good to go as long as your run it from that directory.
