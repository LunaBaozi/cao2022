Rifdock is too big too include here. If you're way in the future and rifdock doesn't work anymore, you can probably get by with just
  using PatchDock outputs as input for the predictor step. These aren't going to be great docks, but after going through the motif graft
  stage, you should end up with comparable results (maybe run motif graft twice?)
